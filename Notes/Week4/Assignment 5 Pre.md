### Topological Sorting

- **Topological Sorting**: This is a method of ordering the vertices of a directed graph such that for every directed edge from vertex �A to vertex �B, vertex �A comes before vertex �B in the ordering. This sorting is possible only if the graph has no directed cycles, i.e., the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
- The exercise involves applying topological sorting to three different directed graphs, determining whether a sort is possible, and if so, showing the result and explaining how it was achieved. If a sort is not possible, the reason must be explained, likely due to the presence of a cycle.

### The Partition Procedure and Alternative Loop Invariants

- **Partition Procedure**: This is crucial in the quicksort algorithm, where an array is divided into two parts, such that one part contains elements less than a chosen pivot element, while the other part contains elements greater than the pivot.
- **Loop Invariants**: These are conditions that hold true before and after each iteration of a loop, ensuring the correctness of the algorithm. The assignment involves adding and testing alternative loop invariants to modify the behavior or efficiency of the partition procedure.
- The assignment asks for an explanation of a code structure used to test different partition functions, the purpose of a specific line of code, and steps involved in timing code segments in C/C++.

### Quicksort, Improved Quicksort, and Hybrid Quicksort

- **Quicksort**: A fast sorting algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer approach. It partitions an array into two halves, then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.
- **Improved Quicksort**: Enhances basic quicksort by selecting a random pivot to potentially improve performance, especially on sorted or nearly sorted data.
- **Hybrid Quicksort**: Combines quicksort with another sorting algorithm (like insertion sort) for small array segments to improve overall performance. The assignment involves finding the optimal segment size for switching to the insertion sort.
- The task includes modifying functions to implement the improved and hybrid versions of quicksort, analyzing their performance across different data sets, and determining under what conditions the improved quicksort outperforms the basic version.
