In the context of topological sorting, the term "sorting" refers more to an ordering or sequencing of vertices in a directed graph rather than sorting in the traditional sense of arranging numbers or elements in ascending or descending order. Specifically, a topological sort of a directed graph arranges its vertices in a linear order in such a way that for every directed edge from vertex A to vertex B, vertex A comes before vertex B in the order.

This topological ordering is possible only if the graph has no directed cycles, meaning it must be a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). If the graph contains a cycle, no linear ordering satisfies the condition, and therefore, a topological sort cannot be performed.

The importance of topological sorting lies in its application to scheduling problems, dependency resolution, and other scenarios where a sequence of tasks must be performed while respecting certain precedence constraints. For example, in building projects, certain tasks must be completed before others can begin. Topological sorting can provide an order to execute tasks such that all prerequisites for any given task are completed before the task begins.
