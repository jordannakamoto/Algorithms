I've compiled and run the factorial.c program, and it computes successive factorials until integer overflow occurs, printing each factorial value along the way.
To determine the largest value of n for which n! can be computed as an int, we need to consider the maximum value that an int can hold. On most systems, an int is a 32-bit signed integer, which means it can store values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
The pattern for factorials ending in zeros is related to the prime factorization of the factorials. If n! ends in one or more zeros, it means that n! is divisible by powers of 10, which comes from the product of factors that are multiples of 2 and 5 (since 10 = 2 * 5). If n! ends in one zero, it means that n! is divisible by 10 (at least one factor of 2 and one factor of 5). If n! ends in two zeros, it means that n! is divisible by 100 (at least two factors of 2 and two factors of 5), and so on.

For n! to fit in an int, the largest value of n that satisfies this condition is 12. This is because 13! = 6,227,020,800, which exceeds the maximum value of an int.

To increase the range of factorials that can be computed, we can modify the program to use a long int instead of an int for the fact variable and associated elements. On most systems, a long int is a 64-bit signed integer, which can store values from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
With this change, the largest value of n for which n! can be computed without overflow is 20. This is because 21! = 51,090,942,171,709,440,000, which exceeds the maximum value of a long int.
